# Assumptions

This document outlines the key assumptions underpinning the simulation model, ensuring that each aspect of the model is rooted in sound theoretical foundations.

## 1. Causal Determinism

The model assumes that all human behavior is **causally determined** by prior events, environmental factors, and internal psychological states. Every decision or action has an identifiable cause, allowing the simulation to map out the chain of causal relationships.

### 1.1 **Freud’s Psychoanalytic Theory**
The model draws on Freudian concepts, particularly the idea that many human actions are driven by subconscious forces. By considering both conscious and unconscious factors, the simulation accounts for deeper, often hidden, causes of behavior.

- **Subconscious Influence**: Many decisions are influenced by unrecognized desires, fears, or conflicts that operate beneath the surface of conscious awareness.

## 2. Language as a Proxy for Thought

Language is treated not only as a tool for communication but as a **direct expression of thought processes**, shaped by both cognitive and emotional factors. This assumption is key to the simulation’s ability to transform language into structured data that reflects underlying mental states.

- **Explicit and Implicit Information**: Both the direct statements and the subtext of language contribute to the simulation’s understanding of decision-making processes.

## 3. Probabilistic Reasoning

While the model is largely deterministic, it also integrates **probabilistic reasoning** to handle uncertainty. This assumption allows the simulation to account for variability and unpredictability, particularly when modeling complex human behaviors or decisions influenced by chaotic or quantum forces.

### 3.1 **Quantum Randomness**
In some cases, human behavior can appear random or unpredictable. The model assumes that this randomness can be simulated using **quantum-inspired probabilistic models**.

## 4. Minimalist Data Representation

The simulation assumes that every interaction can be reduced to its most essential components without losing critical information. This principle ensures that the data is as compact as possible while still retaining all necessary causal and linguistic elements.

- **Structured Data**: Language and behavior are represented in a structured data format that captures both explicit and implicit content, allowing the simulation to process communication efficiently.

## 5. Iterative Refinement

The model operates under the assumption that **iterative refinement** will continually improve the accuracy of the simulation. Each iteration builds on the feedback from previous cycles, adjusting causal links and language models based on new data.

**Note**: These assumptions form the foundation of the simulation and guide the development of the Causality and Language Analysis Frameworks.
