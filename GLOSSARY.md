# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the simulation project.

## 1. Causality
The relationship between a cause and its effect. In the context of this model, **causality** refers to the deterministic links between actions, decisions, and outcomes.

## 2. Language Analysis Framework
A system that processes human language, transforming both explicit statements and implicit cues (e.g., emotions, subtext) into structured data for causal modeling.

## 3. Quantum Randomness
A concept from quantum mechanics that refers to the inherent unpredictability in certain processes (e.g., radioactive decay). In this simulation, **quantum randomness** introduces unpredictability into the decision-making process.

## 4. Feedback Loop
A system in which the outputs of a process are fed back into the system as inputs. This allows for iterative refinement and the continuous improvement of the simulation’s accuracy.

## 5. Determinism
The belief that all events are caused by preceding factors and that nothing happens randomly. In this model, **determinism** forms the basis for understanding human behavior.

## 6. Probabilistic Reasoning
A method of reasoning that incorporates uncertainty, often using statistical models to predict outcomes when deterministic causality cannot fully account for the complexity of a system.

## 7. Edge Case
A scenario that falls outside the typical range of expected conditions. In this model, **edge cases** test the simulation’s ability to handle extreme or unusual scenarios.

## 8. Iterative Refinement
A process of continuously improving a system by using feedback from prior iterations to adjust and optimize the model.

## 9. Subtext
The underlying meaning or implication behind a statement, often not directly stated but inferred from context, tone, or emotional cues.

## 10. Chaos Theory
A branch of mathematics that deals with complex systems whose behavior is highly sensitive to initial conditions, making long-term prediction impossible in many cases.
